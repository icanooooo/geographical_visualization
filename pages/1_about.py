The aim of this project is this showcase and practice my abilities in creating dashboard using streamlit within a simulated case scenario. By no means that the data shown in this project represent whatsoever of the current reality in Indonesia (for example Indonesia use direct popular vote for it voting system rather than electoral college shown in this dashboard).")
